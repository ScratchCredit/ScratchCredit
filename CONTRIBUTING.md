# ScratchCredit's Contributing Policy
You may ***NOT***, in any way, commit any change, and we mean **any change** that will not work with Youssef ("ScratchCredit Server Host"). You may only commit changes that will work with him. The change that will ***NOT*** work with the ScratchCredit Server Host is changing the project ID to anything else other than the ScratchCredit Server Host's ScratchCredit project id. Doing otherwise will result in getting permanently blocked from accessing and kicked out of the entire GitHub organization to prevent further disturbance from those who don't follow ScratchCredit's contributing policy.
