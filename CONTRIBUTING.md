# ScratchCredit's Contributing Policy
You may ***NOT***, in any way, commit any change, and we mean **any change** that will not work with Youssef. He is the server host and creator of ScratchCredit, so you may only commit changes that will work with him. The change that will ***NOT*** work with the server host is changing the project ID to anything else other than Youssef's version of ScratchCredit. Doing otherwise will result in getting permanently blocked from the entire GitHub organization to prevent further disturbance from those who don't follow ScratchCredit's contributing policy.
