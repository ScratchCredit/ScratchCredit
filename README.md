# ScratchCredit
This repository contains all the server code for ScratchCredit, a (pretend) currency on Scratch (created by Youssef) which is still being developed. If you're one of the Blocklive collaborators, go here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/950783494/editor
## API
It's pretty obvious how the API hasn't been developed yet. I mean, just look at `main.py`! Look at it! Do you see any notice that 2 responses use that has `The ScratchCredit API hasn't been implemented yet` in it?!
