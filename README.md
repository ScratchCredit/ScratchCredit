# ScratchCredit
This repository contains all the server code for ScratchCredit, a (pretend) currency on Scratch (created by Youssef) which is still being developed. If you're one of the Blocklive collaborators, go here: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/977092162/editor
## API
It's pretty obvious how the API hasn't been developed yet. I mean, just look at `main.py`! Look at it! Do you see any notice that all 2 requests use as a response that contains `The ScratchCredit API hasn't been implemented yet` in it?!
## Did you know...
* ...that ScratchCredit was originally just a test of ScratchAttach to see how it works?
* ...that ScratchCredit was supposed to be called ScratchCoins before Youssef realized that the name "coin" wasn't allowed in a Scratch pretend currency's name?
* ...that ScratchCredit might, in the future, when it gets shared, get more views than BlockBit, the inspiration (and partial base) for ScratchCredit?
